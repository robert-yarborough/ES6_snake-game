# ES6_snake-game

Build “Snake”, the classic arcade game in which a player controls a snake, guiding it towards
food and away from walls or itself. The game should listen to the arrow keys, and the snake
should grow as it consumes food. When the snake collides with itself or a wall, the game should
end.
