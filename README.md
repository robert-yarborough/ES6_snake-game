# ES6_snake-game

Build “Snake”, the classic arcade game in which a player controls a snake, guiding it towards
food and away from walls or itself. The game should listen to the arrow keys, and the snake
should grow as it consumes food. When the snake collides with itself or a wall, the game should
end.

## Build Instructions:
* **step 1:** npm install 
* **step 2:** npm run build 
* **step 3:** npm run start:dev ( A local server will be spun up at http://localhost:8080/ 

## Play the Game:
### Once the server has loaded properly in your browser, use the keypad to control the pixelated square ( representing the snake ), and try to direct it to the red square ( representing the apple ). If you go out of bounds, you will recieve a prompt with instructions to start the game over.
